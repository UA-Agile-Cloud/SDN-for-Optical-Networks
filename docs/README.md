# Software-Defined Networking (SDN)

Software defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a valuable tool to enable greater control and customization of network operation. It decouples the control plane from the data plane, recognizes the network as an operating system and abstracts the applications from the hardware, thus enhancing network flexibility, interoperability and intelligence.

SDN implementations for optical networks are more complex since they must account for physical layer constraints including optical signal reachability, bandwidth availability and granularity, physical layer impairments, light path routing, and light path reconfiguration speed. 

# Research Community

This research community consist of
- [Center for Integrated Access Networks (CIAN)](http://cian-erc.webhost.uits.arizona.edu/)
- [Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Future Networks and Communications (CONNECT)](https://connectcentre.ie/)
- [Computer Science Research Institute (CSRI)](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CSRI/)
- [Irish Photonic Integration Centre (IPIC)](http://www.ipic.ie/). 

The goal is to explore cutting-edge researches and technologies on software-defined optical networks with full physical layer controls, enabling physical layer programmability through open control systems.
