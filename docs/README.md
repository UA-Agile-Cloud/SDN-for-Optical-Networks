# Software-Defined Networking (SDN)

Software defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a valuable tool to enable greater control and customization of network operation. It decouples the control plane from the data plane, recognizes the network as an operating system and abstracts the applications from the hardware, thus enhancing network flexibility, interoperability and intelligence.

SDN implementations for optical networks are more complex since they must account for physical layer constraints including optical signal reachability, bandwidth availability and granularity, physical layer impairments, light path routing, and light path reconfiguration speed. 

# Research Community

This research community consist of
- [Center for Integrated Access Networks (**CIAN**)\*](http://cian-erc.webhost.uits.arizona.edu/)
- [Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Future Networks and Communications (**CONNECT**)](https://connectcentre.ie/)
- [Computer Science Research Institute (**CSRI**)](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CSRI/)
- [Irish Photonic Integration Centre (**IPIC**)](http://www.ipic.ie/). 

The goal is to explore cutting-edge research and technologies on software-defined optical networks with full physical layer controls, enabling physical layer programmability through open control systems.

\*The Center for Integrated Access Networks (CIAN) is an NSF Engineering Research Center funded through grant #EEC-0812072.

# Ongoing Project:

- [transparent Software-Defined Exchange (tSDX)](https://ua-agile-cloud.github.io/tSDX/): inter-domain exchange can be realized in the optical layer by real-time signal quality monitoring mechanism and inter-domain control capability.
- Mininet emulation for optical networks: Mininet extentions are under development for modeling optical physical layer, which can enable emulation of SDN control of optical systems in large-scale optical networks.

# Funding Information

This work is developed as part of the Department of Energy Office of Science (DOE) funded TURBO project (grant #DE-SC0015867).

- TURBO: Terabits/s Using Reconfigurable Bandwidth Optics: This project aims to develop an optical physical layer orchestrator within a software defined networking (SDN) framework and the physical layer performance guarantees necessary to establish transparent optical paths on demand both within a single network domain and across domains. Flexible grid networking will be used to adaptively assign fiber spectrum matched to channel performance requirements. TURBO will examine both hardware and software SDN control systems to realize end to end multi-Tb/s optical connections in a multi-domain environment.
